# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not based on various medical and personal attributes. The dataset is analyzed, preprocessed, and modeled using multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes several health-related features such as:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant  
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration  
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)  
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)²)  
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Genetic influence of diabetes  
- **Age**: Age of the person (years)  
- **Outcome**: 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
   - Addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE**
   - Hyper parameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**

2. **Model Training**
   Models trained with different preprocessing setups:
   - Scaled only  
   - Scaled + SMOTE  
   - Scaled + SMOTE + Hyperparameter Tuning  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   Metrics used for evaluation:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score

## 🏆 Best Performing Models
- **Random Forest (Scaled only)** and **Logistic Regression (Scaled only)** both achieved:
  - **Accuracy:** 0.76  
  - **Precision:** ~0.75  
  - **F1-Score:** ~0.75  

These models performed best in balancing accuracy and stability.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Proper scaling significantly improves model performance.  
- SMOTE helps address imbalance but may introduce slight overfitting if not tuned carefully.  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest were the most robust models for this dataset.
